The following API fetches data from NYC public database and shows on what days had the highest death due to COVID.

For this project, I decided to use the NYC OpenData. I decided to go with “COVID-19 highest Deaths Count in NYC”. Here are the necessary links.

https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/COVID-19-Daily-Counts-of-Cases-Hospitalizations-an/rc75-m7u3

https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/rc75-m7u3.json

First, I used the JSON File to fetch all the data. After that, I focused only on dates and covid_deaths. Once I got that result, I sorted the data in ascending order to see what day had the highest death count. I focused on five days and did a bar chart based on those days. To create the bar chart I used " https://documentation.image-charts.com/ "
