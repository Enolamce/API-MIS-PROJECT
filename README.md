# API-MIS-PROJECT
The following API fetches data from NYC public database and shows on what day were the highest death due to covid 

For this project, I decided to use the NYC OpenData. I decided to go with “COVID-19 highest Deaths Count in NYC”. Here are the necessary links. 

https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/COVID-19-Daily-Counts-of-Cases-Hospitalizations-an/rc75-m7u3
 
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/rc75-m7u3.json

First i used the JSON File to fetch all the data. After that i focused only on date and covid_deaths. Once i got that result i sorted the data in ascending order so i could see what day had the highest death count. 
I decided to focus on 5 days and did a bar chart based on those days.
To create the bar chart i used " https://documentation.image-charts.com/ "
